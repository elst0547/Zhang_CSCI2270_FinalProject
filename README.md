# Zhang_CSCI2270_FinalProject
####**Project	Summary**
A calculator that does calculation by converting infix expressions to reverse polish expressions
####**How	to	Run**
There's a test file named main.cpp. Download all the files to the same directory and compile all the files.
The executable would ask you to input an expression and would print out the result of that expression automatically.
####**Dependencies**
We are not using any third-party library. All you need is a c++ compiler that supports the standard libraries and standard template libraries(which the compiler is supposed to). Additionally, I use 'auto' type specifier which is a C++11 extension to to use the range-based loop. You can modify them to normal for-loop so that you would not need to use c++11;


    g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp Zcal.cpp RPolish.cpp  // this is an example for g++
####**System	Requirements**
Works on windows, mac and linux
